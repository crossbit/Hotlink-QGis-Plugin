Name : AEAG - Hotlink 
Description : Triggers actions on single click


Purpose: To facilitate the use of actions attached to vector layers

Principle: when the plugin is activated (button in the toolbar), the objects "carriers" of actions become "clickable". The associated action is triggered immediately if it is only a list is available if necessary.

Python example of an action for opening a URL : os.system("start http://a.domain.name/[% \"id\" %]")
